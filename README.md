# Unexpected token '}' in JSON at position ... in Node.js Express.js

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered in Node.js Express.js applications: the "Unexpected token '}' in JSON at position ..." error.  This error typically arises when the application attempts to parse invalid or malformed JSON data received, for example, during a POST request.

The `bug.js` file contains code that reproduces this error. The `bugSolution.js` file shows how to resolve the issue using robust error handling and JSON validation.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `node bug.js`.  You will likely need to send a malformed JSON POST request to trigger the error (see instructions below).
4. Examine the error message in the console.
5. Run `node bugSolution.js` to see how improved error handling can be implemented.

**Sending a Malformed JSON POST request:** You can use tools like curl or Postman.  Send a POST request to `http://localhost:3000/` with a body that violates JSON syntax.  For example, a body like this will trigger the error: `{"key":"value",}` (missing closing brace).
